/**
 * <b>SIP Redirect Plug-in overview</b>
 * 
 *  A redirect plug-in is a logical entity that is, in its general form,
 *  responsible for mapping a Request URI to a set of one or more
 *  alternative locations at which the target of that URI can be found.  
 *  A redirect plug-in is at liberty of choosing the redirection policies by 
 *  which it establishes that mapping but it will generally be dictated
 *  by the nature of the specialized redirection function that it
 *  provides. For example, a redirector plug-in whose function it is to map an AOR to 
 *  its registered Contacts will do so by consulting the location database.
 *  
 * <b>Relationship with the SIP Redirect Server</b>
 * 
 *  Each Redirect Plug-in is created by the SIP Redirect Server (see SipRedirectServer).
 *  For every request that the SIP Redirect Server processes it will 
 *  call the plug-in's lookUp() or observe() method based on whether or not
 *  it wants the plug-in to provide Contacts for the request or merely observe it. 
 * 
 * <b>paragraph Redirect Plug-in requirements</b>
 *  
 *  In order to create a redirect plug-in that will be called upon by the 
 *  SipRedirectServer to play a part in the redirection effort, a certain
 *  set of requirements must be met.  
 *   - Firstly, the redirect plug-in must be derived from the RedirectPlugin 
 *     class and provide an implementation for its pure virtual methods and 
 *     optionally its virtual methods.
 *  
 *   - Secondly, to configure the redirect plug-in into the SipRedirectServer, 
 *     the registrar-config file must have a directive configuring the plugin 
 *     library:
 *     @code
 *         SIP_REDIRECT_HOOK_LIBRARY.[###-UNIQUE_NAME] : [path to libexampleregplugin.so]
 *     @endcode
 *     Where: ### is a three-digit value representing the ordinal number for the plug-in.
 *            UNIQUE_NAME is a unique name representing the plugin. 
 *            path points to the library that provides the plugin code.
 *     
 *   - Thirdly, the redirect plug-in must provide a factory routine named 
 *     getRedirectPlugin with extern "C" linkage so that the OsSharedLib mechanism 
 *     can look it up in the dynamically loaded library (looking up C++ symbols is 
 *     problematic because of name mangling).
 *     The factory routine looks like:
 *     @code
 *         class ExampleRedirectPlugin : public RedirectPlugin
 *         {
 *            ...
 *             friend RedirectPlugin* getRedirectPlugin(const UtlString& instanceName);
 *             ...
 *         };
 * 
 *         extern "C" RedirectPlugin* getRedirectPlugin(const UtlString& instanceName)
 *         {
 *            return new ExampleRegisterPlugin(instanceName);
 *         }
 *     @endcode
 *
 * @see Plugin
 * @see SipRedirectServer for more details on how and when the methods of RedirectPlugin are being called 
 *      and to get additional information about the redirection process in general.
 *

    * After considering the request, if a redirect plug-in establishes that 
    * the request is not interesting given the redirection policy it implements,
    * it must return SUCCESS and MUST NOT modify the supplied ContactList in ANY way.  
    * 
    * On the other hand, if the plug-in establishes that the request is one that 
    * it should handle to affect its redirection, the plug-in must perform
    * all the necessary modifications tn the supplied ContactList to satisfy
    * the redirection policy it implements. These trasnformations include:
    *  - Addition of new contact(s);
    *  - Removal of one, many or all contacts;

    * When a redirect plug-in is asked to look-up a request, that plug-in, upon inspection

    * include missing vital headers, invalid user or domain, unsupported extension, ...

    * the error condition detected.     
    *
    * If the redirect plug-in cannot complete the processing of the 
    * request quickly, it must arrange for asynchronous processing that 
    * will bring the redirector into a state where it can complete its processing 
    * quickly and return SEARCH_PENDING.  Asynchronous processing then calls
