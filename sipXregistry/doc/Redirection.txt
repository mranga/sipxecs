			       Overview

  The sipXregistry redirect server maps addresses in a series of
  lookups, adding Contacts for each to a result set.  In addition,
  some redirectors (processing steps) can edit Contacts found by
  earlier redirectors.  When all the lookups are complete, it returns
  a redirect response to the request based on the contents of the
  result set (or a not found response if the result set is empty).


			   The Redirectors

  The redirectors are (in their current order):

  ++ Registrations ($prefix/var/sipxdata/sipdb/registration.xml)

     If the target URI matches a registered address, then the Contact
     addresses sent in the registration are added.  These are stored
     in the in-memory database, but are made persistent in the XML
     file.

  ++ Aliases ($prefix/var/sipxdata/sipdb/alias.xml)

     The file maps addresses based on the contacts configured in the
     XML file.  Each AOR can translate to any number of contacts.
     This is used for direct mappings such as a user name for use in a
     SIP URL to an extension number (or the reverse).  There is an
     example alias.xml file in this directory.

  ++ SUBSCRIBE Processing

     If the request method is SUBSCRIBE, this step removes the q
     values from all the contacts, so the SUBSCRIBE always forks in
     parallel rather than in series.  This ensures that the subscriber
     gets a prompt response from all targets for the requested
     extension.  This is placed here in the order so that it does not
     apply to contacts added by later phases, but affects only
     contacts added by user agents directly or provisioned aliase;
     this has the effect that low q-value contacts like fallback to
     voicemail are not pursued.  Since most SUBSCRIBEs are concerned
     only with local events, this reduces the number of messages
     forked to systems that don't do anything useful with them anyway.

  ++ Mapping Rules ($prefix/etc/sipxpbx/mappingrules.xml)

     Mapping rules provide the means to select addresses based on host
     and user name patterns and configured permissions, and then add
     contacts.  Mapping rules may use the results of those matches and
     other configured data to add contacts to the result set.

  ++ Fallback Mapping Rules ($prefix/etc/sipxpbx/fallbackrules.xml)

     This phase is used _only_ if there are no contacts in the result
     set when it is reached; if the result set is non-empty, this
     phase is skipped.  This is normally used to provide mapping to
     non-local addresses (such as to a gateway or the proxy
     authoritative for another domain).  The mapping rules file in
     this phase uses the same syntax and expressive ability as the
     first Mapping Rules phase.

  ++ Global Call Pick-Up Processing
     ($prefix/var/sipxdata/sipdb/credentials.xml)

     This redirector handles the mappings needed by the Global Call
     Pick-Up feature.  It does two mappings:  It maps the global call
     pick-up feature code to a proper invocation of the pick-up agent,
     and it maps the special "all extensions" user name
     ("~~sp~allcredentials") to all URIs in the credentials.xml file.

  ++ Caller Alias Processing
     ($prefix/var/sipxdata/sipdb/caller-alias.xml)

     This redirector processes Contacts added by earlier steps to
     determine if there is a caller alias defined for the identity of
     the caller when calling to the target domain.  At this time, the
     identity of the caller is just the From header identity (the
     identity being just the 'user@domain' part of the uri).  The
     target domain is the domain part of the Contact URI.  For each
     Contact, these values are extracted and a lookup is done in the
     caller-alias database.  First, both values are used; if this
     specific entry is found, then the returned caller_alias value is
     added to the Contact as the value of the From field header
     parameter.  If there is no specific entry, then the database is
     checked for an entry that specifies the target domain with no
     identity; if this domain wildcard entry is found, then the
     returned From field value is used as the From value.  If there
     are no Contacts, this step is a no-op; it never adds Contact
     values.

  Other Configuration files
  =========================

  The following configuration files are also important, but they are
  also shared with other components, so they are documented in
  sipXcommserverLib/doc:

  $prefix/var/sipxdata/sipdb/credentials.xml
     Defines all user identities and the credentials used to
     authenticate them.

  $prefix/var/sipxdata/sipdb/permission.xml
     Defines permissions granted to each identity.


		  Suspending redirection processing

  When a redirector processes a request, it returns a status code.  The
  values are SUCCESS, ERROR (which means that redirection should
  terminate immediately with a 500 error response), and SUSPEND.  If the
  redirector returns SUSPEND, it is indicating that its processing
  cannot be completed quickly.

  Before returning SUSPEND, the redirector is responsible for arranging
  for asynchronous processing that will bring the redirector into a
  state where it can complete its processing quickly.  Asynchronous
  processing then calls a function to indicate to the redirect server
  that the request should be reprocessed.

  The redirect server will the re-execute the redirectors for the
  request.  The redirectors are expected to succeed, after which the
  redirect server sends a response to the request.  (A redirector is
  allowed to return SUSPEND several times for a single request, but
  this should be avoided for efficiency.)

  A redirector has a method by which the redirect server may inform it
  that a request that it is working on has been canceled.  Such
  cancellation may be due to a CANCEL from the requester, a transaction
  time-out (because some redirector remained suspended too long),
  reinitialization of the redirect server, or an error response from
  another redirector.

  If a redirector asks for suspension, processing continues with the
  other redirectors in the sequence, but at the end of processing, the
  response that is being generated is discarded, and the entire sequence
  is re-executed once all the redirectors have indicated that they can
  succeed, generating a new, correct response.  This is somewhat
  inefficient, but there is no simple scheme to make it more efficient
  that does not place tight constraints on the redirectors that we may
  want to loosen in the near future.  The current target is that a
  suspended redirection should take no more than twice the work of a
  non-suspended redirection, and that a very small fraction of
  redirection requests will be suspended.

  Each request that is suspended has a sequence number that is unique
  over long periods of time.  Currently, the sequence number is a 32 bit
  unsigned integer that increments for every request.  It is given to
  each redirector and is used to identify the request.

  Redirectors may maintain their own data storage in one of two ways.

  The first method is simple to code but is single-threaded.  The
  redirect server maintains for every suspended request and every
  redirector a pointer to private storage for that redirector.  The
  redirector may allocate an object and save the pointer to it.  The
  redirect server guarantees to delete the object (thus executing its
  destructor) after processing of the request is done.  Using service
  methods, the redirector can find the object for any particular
  sequence number, or examine the objests for all suspended requests.
  However, any access to these objects requires holding a global mutex.

  The second method is more complex to code but can be parallelized.
  That method is for the redirector to maintain its own data structures,
  using the request serial numbers to coordinate its data items with the
  redirect server's list of suspended requests.  The redirect server
  guarantees to call the redirector's "cancel request" method once its
  services are no longer needed for that request.  The redirector's
  "cancel request" method can free storage allocated for the request.
