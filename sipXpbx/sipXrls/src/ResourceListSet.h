 * ResourceListSet's can be entirely independent.
 * The ResourceListSet has a lock for all modifications.  A small number of
 * methods are allowed to be "externally called" by threads that do not
 * already possess the lock.
 * The ResourceListSet "externally callable" methods are responsible for

   // ResourceListSet.mPublishingTimer.oneshotAfter(ResourceListServer::mPublishingDelay).

   // ResourceListTask, which calls ResourceListSet::publish, which calls
   // ResourceList::publishIfNecessary on every ResourceList.

   // Since reported dialogs that have terminated are supposed to be
   // published with their "terminated" state (and their termination
   // reasons, if possible) shown before they vanish from the resource
   // instance, terminated ResourceInstance's are not deleted immediately,
   // but rather are left to be published as such.
   // ResourceListSet::publish, after publishing the new content, calls
   // ResourceCached::purgeTerminated to destroy the ResourceInstance's.
   // 
   // This is further complicated by the mechanism to suppress publishing
   // when there are large transient changes being made to the content.
   // Currently, this mechanism is used only by ResourceListFileReader when
   // it clears and reloads the ResourceListSet when resource-lists.xml
   // changes.
   // 
   // Publishing is suppressed by calling ResourceListSet::suspendPublishing
   // and resumed by calling ResourceListSet::resumePublishing.  While
   // suspension is in effect, no publishing is done, and the
   // mChangesToPublish's are not reset.  When suspension ends, the usual
   // publishing is resumed.  Suspending publishing prevents publishing of
   // terminated dialogs, which is theoretically required.
   // 
   // 
   // The various changes that can be made to a resource list set and how
   // they get published:
