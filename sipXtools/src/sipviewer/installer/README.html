<h1> SIPVIEWER </h1>
<p>Sipviewer is a program for displaying SIP message traces as "ladder
diagrams".  Most of its features are self-explanatory, but here are a
few notes for its more obscure aspects.

<p>Sipviewer's input is XML files in the "SIP trace" format.  They are
usually generated by syslog2siptrace from sipX log files.  SIP trace
files can be combined and filtered with siptrace-merge.

<p> When the mouse is over a message in the ladder diagram, the messages
are color-coded to show their relationship to the selected message:

<ul>
<li>Red  -- the selected message
<li>Green --  other messages in the same hop-by-hop transaction
<li>Blue --  other messages in the same end-to-end transaction
<li>Yellow -- other messages in the same dialog
<li>White -- unrelated messages
</ul>

<p>
Within the middle three categories (green, blue, and yellow), the
color is darker if the message appears to be in a "sibling fork" of
the selected message, and lighter if the message appears to be in the
same fork (because it has the same from-tag and to-tag).

<p>
Usually the colors make intuitive sense, but there is the anomalous
case that an INVITE and its 100 response appear to be in a different
fork than the 180 response, the 200 response, and the ACK because the
latter messages have a to-tag.

<p>
If you click on a message, sipviewer pops up a window showing the
message.  The contents of the window can be selected by typing
control-A into the window.  The window must be closed via your window
manager.

<p>The initial order of the columns is determined by the order the
addresses appear in the input file.  But you can rearrange the
columns:  If you click in the header area between two columns,
sipviewer will swap the two columns. The popup windows showing 
the messages can be closed with ESC.
