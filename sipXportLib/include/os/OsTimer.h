/**
 * This class implements one-shot and periodic timers.
 * 
 * Once a timer is created, it must be started.  After the specified time,
 * the timer expires or "fires", at which point (depending on how the
 * timer was created) an OsNotification object is used to signal an
 * event, or a message is posted to a specified queue.
 * 
 * A timer may be stopped at any time (except when the timer is being
 * destroyed).  The destructor calls stop() before freeing the timer.
 *
 * If the stop() is synchronous, it may block, but it ensures that any
 * event routine call will have finished before stop() returns.  If
 * the stop() is asynchronous, it will not block, but an event routine
 * execution that has been previously committed may execute after stop()
 * returns.  (For one-shot timers, this can be detected by examining the
 * return value of stop().)
 * 
 * Once a timer is stopped with stop() or by firing (if it is a one-shot
 * timer), it can be started again.  The time interval of a timer can be
 * changed every time it is started, but its notification information is
 * fixed when it is created.
 * 
 * All methods can be used concurrently, except that no other method may be
 * called concurrently with the destructor (which cannot be made to work,
 * as the destructor deletes the timer's memory).  Note that a timer may
 * fire while it is being deleted; the destructor handles this situation
 * correctly, the timer is guaranteed to exist until after the event
 * routine returns.
 * 
 * An event routine should be non-blocking, because it is called on
 * the timer task thread.  Within an event routine, all non-blocking
 * methods may be executed on the timer.  When the event routine of a
 * one-shot timer is entered, the timer is in the stopped state.  When
 * the event routine of a periodic timer is entered, the timer is
 * still in the running state.
 * 
 * (If mbManagedNotifier is set, the timer may not be destroyed (using
 * deleteAsync, which is non-blocking), as that destroys the
 * OsNotifier object whose method is the event notifier that is
 * currently running.  But there is no current interface for creating
 * that situation.)
 * 
 * Most methods are non-blocking, except to seize the timer's mutex
 * and to post messages to the timer task's message queue.  The
 * exceptions are the destructor and synchronous stops, which must
 * block until they get a response from the timer task.
 * 
 * If VALGRIND_TIMER_ERROR is defined, additional code is created to
 * detect and backtrace errors in timer usage.  This code causes run-time
 * errors that Valgrind can detect to produce backtraces of where the
 * invalid method invocations were made.
 * 
 * If NDEBUG is defined, some checking code that is used only to trigger
 * asserts is omitted.  (To prevent chaos when different libraries are
 * compiled with different options, defining NDEBUG does *not* change
 * the members of the objects.)
