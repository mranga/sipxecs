Download JDK from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads (or http://java.sun.com/products/archive) and put .bin file in ~/libsrc/java-sun

Build RPMs (from lib directory):
 make java-sun

RPMs are in lib/dist/RPMS directory - install by running (as root):

rpm -Uhv java-1.6.0-sun-1.6.0.11-1jpp.i586.rpm \
    java-1.6.0-sun-devel-1.6.0.11-1jpp.i586.rpm \
    java-1.6.0-sun-plugin-1.6.0.11-1jpp.i586.rpm \
    java-1.6.0-sun-src-1.6.0.11-1jpp.i586.rpm  \
    java-1.6.0-sun-alsa-1.6.0.11-1jpp.i586.rpm

Make sure that java-sun is a default JVM (as root):

alternatives --config java
alternatives --config javac
