/// Manipulate sipXauthproxy state information in Record-Route and Route headers.
/**
 * The sipXauthproxy uses this class to encode state information to be carried by
 * the request messages in a dialog.  Normally, this class is used only by an
 * AuthPlugin object in its implementation of AuthPlugin::authorizeAndModify.
 *
 * State is encoded as name/value pairs.
 * The name is composed of two parts, each of which may consist only of
 * A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore (_), and dash (-).:
 * - instanceName: The name of the AuthPlugin.  This name is a configuration
 *                 value: @see AuthPlugin::AuthPlugin).
 *                 Some parameters are designed to be shared among plugins;
 *                 these should be implemented as methods in RouteState, and
 *                 should pass the null string for instanceName (for an example,
 *                 see RouteState::directionIsCallerToCalled).
 * - parameterName: The name for this parameter chosen by the caller.
 * 
 * Obeying this naming convention ensures that an AuthPlugin will not
 * unintentionally access or modify state for some other AuthPlugin.  If
 * the AuthPlugin uses only one parameter, it may pass an empty string for
 * the parameterName.
 *
 * The state in a message is 'signed' by a hash value that incorporates a
 * secret (see setSecret); this signature binds the message to the call-id
 * and from-tag values from the dialog-forming request.  A state value
 * whose hash value does not match is logged, but is otherwise equivalent
 * to a message for which no state was received (no parameter names or
 * values are available).
 * 
 * State can only be created (encoded) in the initial dialog-forming
 * request message; in subsequent in-dialog requests and in responses, the
 * state can be decoded and read, but cannot be modified.  This is because
 * the state is encoded into a route inserted into a Record-Route: the
 * route set for the dialog is established by the Record-Route header(s) in
 * the request/response messages that create the dialog.  Subsequent
 * messages in the dialog carry those values in Route headers, but they
 * cannot be changed.  To determine whether state can be changed, call
 * isMutable.
 *
 * @Note  The SIP protocol allows a proxy to modify the Record-Route headers in the
 *        dialog-forming response so that the two ends of the dialog see different route sets.
 *        However, the current sipXtackLib design proxies responses before sending them
 *        to the application (sipXauthproxy) layer, so we must use symetric state.
 *        (There are some protocol problems with modifying responses anyway, since in the
 *        case of SUBSCRIBE or other requests that can create multiple dialogs, the
 *        requestor may not see all responses, but because of the stack limitation this
 *        is moot for us)
 *
 * To access the state in a message, construct a RouteState object, passing
 * the message and any Route headers removed by SipMessage::normalizeProxyRoutes to
 * the constructor.  SipRouter::proxyMessage uses the update method to put the updated
 * state back into the message.
 *
 * @Note  A dialog-forming request that passes through the same sipXauthproxy more than
 *        once (spirals) will not get multiple Record-Route headers.  The first spiral to
 *        call the 'update' method adds a Record-Route; subsequent calls modify the state
 *        information recorded in that existing header so that in-dialog requests only
 *        traverse this proxy once.
