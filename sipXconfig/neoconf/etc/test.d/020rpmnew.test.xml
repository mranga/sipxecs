      <description>
        RPM will not overwrite configuration file modified on your system.
        You should compare each of the following files with your version (the same name, without '.rpmnew' suffix).
        To reconcile the differences, check for new settings in the .rpmnew file and copy them to your file.
        When you have finished, remove the .rpmnew file to suppress this warning.
