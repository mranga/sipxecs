  <label>DHCP Test</label>
  <description>
    Verify that the networks DHCP server is running and properly issuing
    IP addresses.
  </description>
  <longDescription>
      From the perspective of phones which will be used as part of a SIPxchange
      PBX, a DHCP server is expected to be present on their network.
      At a minimum, the DHCP server should be provisioned to supply the network
      domain name, network mask, default router address and a list of one or
      more DNS servers. It can optionally supply the IP address of one or more
      NTP servers and configuration server. This test verifies that there is
      at most one DHCP server present on the network being tested and that it
      is supplying the minimal set of network parameters.
      Note that if the DHCP server has been configured for address reservations
      based upon device MAC addresses, it will be necessary to add the special
      MAC address ( 00D01EFFFFFE ) used by these tests to the reservation group.

        No DHCP server responded to the DHCP query. Verify that there
        is a running DHCP server on the network being tested.

      <description>
          More than one DHCP server was detected on the network being tested
          and were attempting to issue IP addresses. This is a serious network
          error condition which needs to be remedied immediately.

      <description>
        The DHCP server rejected a request for IP address assignment. Ensure
        that the DHCP server is properly provisioned to issue IP addresses
